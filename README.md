## Texas Hold'em Poker Win Rate Prediction

This project is aimed at predicting the win rate in Texas Hold'em poker games, using Monte Carlo simulations to help players better understand and optimize their decisions. Below is the detailed description and feature introduction of the project:

### Project Description

In the `initialize.py` file, users can predict the win rate of the current game based on different hole cards and community cards, helping players improve their decision-making skills. By comparing the win rates of different hands, players can better understand their advantages and disadvantages in specific situations.

In the `autoplay.py` file, users can run automatic game simulations, helping them strengthen their intuition for their hand strength and win rate through multiple simulated games, thus optimizing their gaming strategy.

### Feature Introduction

- **Win Rate Prediction**: Accurately predict the player's win rate based on the current hole cards and community cards, helping make more informed decisions.
- **Game Simulation**: Simulate multiple Texas Hold'em poker games and output the win rate of hands, helping users understand the win rate performance in different game situations.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the win rate distribution of different hands under specific conditions, helping players understand the strengths and weaknesses of various hands and how to respond in real-game situations.
